# SEO-optimized-HTML
This was my first project. Task was to create a SEO friendly webapp with only HTML and CSS

What was used:
* Semantic HTML structure: Using the right elements for the right task and in correct order.
* Meta-description for link description: When you google something you will get links with descriptions underneath it. 
* Meta-Keywords for keywords search.
* color-contrast accessibility passing color.review
* Descriptive alt attributes on all images for accessibility.
* Aria attributes on everything clickable buttons and <a> elements for accessibility.
