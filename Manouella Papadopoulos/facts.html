      <h1>Facts about Sunsets</h1>

      <article>
        <h2 class="firstline">What sunsets are</h2>

        <div class="article-box">
          <h3>Scattering of Light</h3>
          <p>
            As the sun begins to set, it appears lower in the sky, and its light
            has to pass through a thicker layer of Earth's atmosphere. This is
            when the magic of a sunset starts. The Earth's atmosphere is
            composed of various gases and particles, which scatter sunlight in
            all directions. However, shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue
            and violet, are scattered more than longer wavelengths, like red and
            orange.
          </p>

          <h3>The Role of Rayleigh Scattering</h3>
          <p>
            Rayleigh scattering phenomenon primarily scatters shorter
            wavelengths of light (blue and violet) in all directions. This is
            why the daytime sky often appears blue, as blue light is scattered
            throughout the atmosphere. During sunset, the sun's light has to
            travel through more air, increasing the scattering effect and
            further enhancing the vividness of the red and orange colors in the
            sky.
          </p>

          <h3>Atmospheric Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            The colors of a sunset can vary greatly depending on the composition
            of the atmosphere and its conditions. Particles, such as dust,
            smoke, or pollutants in the air, can scatter and filter sunlight
            differently, leading to unique color combinations. In some cases,
            these particles can intensify the red and orange hues, creating
            exceptionally vibrant sunsets.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>The Three Stages of a Sunset</h3>
          <h4>First Stage (Golden Hour)</h4>
          <p>
            The early stages of a sunset, the sun is still above the horizon,
            and its light travels through a smaller portion of the atmosphere.
            This creates warm, golden tones in the sky, which photographers
            often refer to as the "golden hour."
          </p>

          <h4>Second Stage</h4>
          <p>
            (Transition to Red and Orange): As the sun gets closer to the
            horizon, it encounters more of Earth's atmosphere. Blue and green
            wavelengths continue to scatter, while red and orange wavelengths
            become more prominent. This transition phase is marked by a stunning
            blend of colors, with the sky often displaying shades of pink,
            purple, and deep red.
          </p>

          <h4>Stage (Deep Twilight)</h4>
          <p>
            The sun is below the horizon, the scattering of blue and green light
            ceases. The sky's dominant colors become deep reds, purples, and
            oranges. This phase is known as twilight, and it gradually fades
            into the darkness of night.
          </p>

          <p>
            In summary: the captivating transformation of colors during a sunset
            is a result of the scattering of light by Earth's atmosphere, with
            the Rayleigh scattering effect playing a crucial role. The unique
            colors and patterns of a sunset are also influenced by atmospheric
            conditions and the presence of particles in the air. Each sunset is
            a work of art, showcasing nature's ability to create breathtaking
            displays of color and beauty, making it a cherished moment for
            people around the world to enjoy and appreciate.

        <div class="article-box">
          <h3>
            Describing Earth's and Mars' Skies: Why Are They Different Colors?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When we look up at the sky on Earth during the day, it's mostly a
            vibrant blue, transitioning to shades of orange and red at dawn and
            dusk. However, Mars presents the opposite spectacle. Its daylight
            sky appears orange-brown, but as the sun sets, it transforms into a
            soothing bluish hue. What's intriguing is that both planets receive
            sunlight from the same sun, yet their skies display such distinct
            colors. The key to this mystery lies in the composition of the
            Martian atmosphere.

          <h3>The Science Behind Varied Sunset Colors</h3>
          <p>
            The sun radiates a spectrum of rays, encompassing high-frequency
            gamma rays to low-frequency radio waves. Among these rays, there's a
            portion known as the visible spectrum, which our eyes can perceive
            as what we commonly call "white light." This visible spectrum is
            composed of seven different wavelengths we remember as VIBGYOR, or
            the colors of the rainbow.

            Now, as sunlight travels to different planets, it encounters varying
            intensities due to factors beyond the light itself. The colors we
            perceive also depend on the medium (particles) through which the
            light passes, a concept often covered in physics classes.
          </p>

          <p>
            When sunlight interacts with different particles, it can be
            absorbed, reflected, or scattered, depending on the properties of
            those particles. Some particles tend to scatter more of the longer
            red wavelengths, while others prefer the shorter blue waves,
            resulting in the colors we see.

          <p>
            Now, let's apply this knowledge to understand why Martian sunsets
            look blue while Earth's sunsets appear red. Mars has an atmosphere
            filled with relatively large dust particles. These particles induce
            a phenomenon known as "Mie Scattering," which effectively filters
            out the red light from the sun's rays and allows only the blue light
            to reach our eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, Earth's atmosphere contains much smaller
            particles compared to the wavelength of light. These tiny particles
            cause "Rayleigh Scattering," which scatters the blue wavelengths
            and, by the time the light reaches our eyes, only the red light
            remains visible.
          </p>

          <p>
            In simple terms, you can think of the atmosphere as a filter for
            sunlight. Earth's atmosphere is proficient at filtering out blue
            light, permitting red light to dominate our sunsets. Conversely, the
            Martian atmosphere excels at filtering out red light, resulting in
            the captivating blue hues of Martian sunsets.
